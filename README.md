# ShowPro

## Purpose
A website that allows the user to search an artist which will present them with a list of upcoming events they can click to open a webpage to purchase tickets through. They will also be presented with information about the artist alongside these events including a picture and the artist's bio. Finally, a history of their searches will be preserved on their device so if they want to quickly revist a previously searched artist they can simply click on the relevent history link.
